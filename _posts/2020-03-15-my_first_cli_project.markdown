I have to be honest, when I began this project, I was pretty overwhelmed. Originally, I intended to use an NBA API from Rapidapi. I mapped out this great idea and I had everything set up. The pseudo code was complete, but I could not get it to work. To use the API, I had to pass a header to an API key to get it working, but everything I tried ultimately failed. I spent about three days trying to get the API working. At that time I had a decision to make, either continue to trouble shoot with the API or abort my original plans and start over choosing a new API. I chose the latter. 

After hours of research, I decided to use the New York Times Bestseller API for a CLI GEM project. The set-up for the project was fairly easy. I utilized AVI’s CLI Gem walkthrough to aid me in this process. The New York Times API was user friendly. The set-up and customization of the API was pretty easily. 

The main functionality of the CLI gem was to greet users with a list of audiobook Bestsellers. The user will then be able to select a number from the list of audiobooks to receive detailed information. Once selected, the user will receive an option to enter “back”, to return the full list of audiobooks. The user may also enter “exit” to leave the page.

For the most part, I’m happy with the outcome of this project. It is not complex, but it is functional. I really enjoyed working through each problem that I encountered to figure out a solution. The biggest challenge of this project, was creating the menu. I realized early on that this method would have to be my main method. I continued to read and research until I was able to figure it out. I will continue expanding on this project, as I feel that it helped me learn a lot of new material, which was a rewarding experience. As previously mentioned, I’m very happy with the result and I look forward to expanding my project’s functionalities.
