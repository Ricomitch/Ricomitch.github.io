When I was younger I was always into technology and creating things. From video games to building model cars I was into it. My first real encounter with web technology has to be Myspace. I remember spending hours upon hours changing the CSS of my profile page to remove things, change colors, etc. I've always been fascinated by the thought of being able to visualize things and actually bring them to life. Fast forward to now when I think about it I was actually CODING, so I guess software development has always been an interest of mine just something I never pursued. See I've always had the notion that you had to be a math wizard in order to become a software engineer. Iâ€™ve always told myself that I wasn't smart enough to become a software engineer. But after talking to friends in the field and doing my own research I found out that wasn't the case. Programming is much like anything else in life with repetition you become better and with time you become seasoned. So I've decided to pursue a dream that I have always thought was to farfetched to obtain. I know with repetition and grit I can come out of the other side a software engineer.
